Joomla-REA-mobile-enhanced-template-override
============================================

The template override for Joomla REA is an enhancement for mobile devices.  It is designed to work out of the box with the Yootheme Master template  but with some tweaks it can be setup to work with other themes as well.  Mainly some CSS styles will have to be modified.
